# $\text{Fusion}_{3,3} \text{ Industrial AI}$

Project $F_{3,3}$: Redefining Industrial Reliability via Multi-modal Fusion. This framework bridges the "Trust Gap" by fusing structured telemetry, environmental context, and unstructured logs. Built on a distributed PySpark architecture with Temporal Fusion Transformers, it targets a 70% reduction in downtime to protect enterprise EBIT margins.

# Project : $F_{3,3}$ Multi-modal Industrial Reliability Framework

## 📌 Overview

**Project $F_{3,3}$** is an end-to-end Industrial AI framework designed to bridge the "Trust Gap" between predictive models and the factory floor. By moving beyond isolated sensor data,  synthesises three distinct data streams to deliver interpretable, production-grade **Remaining Useful Life ()** forecasts.

The framework is architected to transform maintenance from a volatile **Operating Expense (OpEx)** into a predictable driver of **EBIT stability**.

## 🏗 The "Power of Three" Architecture

### 1. Data Fusion (Inputs)

The model synthesises three high-variance data sources to eliminate the "blind spots" of traditional telemetry:

* **Structured Telemetry:** Multi-sensor time-series (NASA C-MAPSS) capturing mechanical degradation trends.
* **Environmental Context:** External stressors including ambient temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.
* **Unstructured Logs:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) of technician maintenance records to capture "human-in-the-loop" observations and historical anomalies.

### 2. Predictive Intelligence (Engine)

* **Distributed ETL:** Built on **PySpark** using Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) to manage data skewness and "As-Of" joins at scale.
* **Advanced Modelling:** Utilises **Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)** for multi-horizon forecasting, providing probabilistic outputs and interpretable attention weights.

### 3. Enterprise MLOps (Deployment)

* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Automated environment provisioning and cloud resource management via **Terraform**.
* **Operational Resiliency:** Designed for high-availability production environments with integrated drift detection and automated model monitoring.

## 📈 Strategic Business Impact

$F_{3,3}$ is calibrated against industry benchmarks to deliver quantifiable financial results and operational excellence:

* **-70% Unscheduled Downtime:** Converting reactive emergency repairs into strategically planned maintenance windows.
* **+20% Asset Longevity:** Optimising machine duty cycles based on real-time health scores to extend the lifecycle of capital equipment.
* **EBIT Protection:** De-risking quarterly earnings by stabilising maintenance OpEx and reducing the variance in production output.
